## Grammar and mechanics

- Some people will read every word you write. Others will just scan. Help everyone by grouping related ideas together and using descriptive headers.
- Focus your message, and create a hierarchy of information. Lead with the main point or the most important content.
- Use active voice and positive language.
- Use short words and sentences.
- Avoid unnecessary modifiers.
- Use specific examples.
- Avoid vague language.
- Be consistent. Adhere to the copy patterns and style points outlined in this guide.
- Feel free to use contractions.
- Use the serial comma. Otherwise, use common sense.
- Don’t use underline, and don’t use any combination of italic, bold, caps, and underline.
- When in doubt, read your writing out loud.
