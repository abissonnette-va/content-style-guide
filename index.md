This style guide was created for Vendasta employees, but we hope it’s helpful for other content and communications teams, too.

## If you work at Vendasta

This is our company style guide. It helps us write clear and consistent content across teams and channels.

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order. The entire guide is searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for.

## If you work at another organization

We invite you to use this guide when writing content for Vendasta, whether it’s a guest post on our blog, a third-party case study, or something else. If you need clarification about anything, please contact dhennig@vendasta.com. 

We welcome any feedback for improving the guide.
