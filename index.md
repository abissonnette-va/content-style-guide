title: Welcome to Vendasta's Style Guide
layout: default
---

This style guide was created for Vendasta employees. It is intended for reference, and we don't expect you to have it memorized. That's why the left nav is so extensive—to aid in making things findable.

## If you work at Vendasta

This guide is here to help us write consistent content across teams and channels.

We’ve divided it by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order.

## If you work at another organization

We invite you to use this guide when writing content for Vendasta, whether it’s a guest post on our blog, a third-party case study, or something else. If you need clarification about anything, please contact dhennig@vendasta.com. 

We welcome any feedback for improving the guide. It's a living document, and it changes over time. When it changes, we generally don't change previously published documentation to match. We strive for consistency, but at any given time there are certain to be pieces of content that don't match this style guide. When in doubt, follow this guide rather than imitating existing documents.
