What’s the difference between voice and tone? 

Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting.

The same is true for Vendasta. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.

## Voice

Vendasta’s voice is human. It’s helpful, friendly, and straightforward. Our priority is explaining our solutions and helping our partners conquer their challenges so they can grow their businesses and their clients’ businesses.

One way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn’t. Vendasta’s voice is:

* Fun but not silly
* Confident but not cocky
* Ambitious but not aggressive
* Helpful but not overbearing
* Expert but not bossy

## Tone

Vendasta’s tone is usually informal, but it’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they relieved to be finished with a campaign? Are they confused and seeking our help? Are they curious about a post on our blog?

Vendasta has a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when it’s appropriate and when it comes naturally. But don’t go out of your way to make a joke—forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face.
