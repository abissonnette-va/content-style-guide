## A Word on "White Label"

The phrase "white label" is one of the trickiest terms to grasp for a lot of people. As a noun, it is two separate words. As an adjective modifying a noun, it is hyphenated. It is never written as one word without a hyphen.

- OK: We support white labeling for vendor products.
- OK: Vendors, like us, have found success in selling white-label products.
- NOT OK: Vendasta offers a whitelabel platform.
