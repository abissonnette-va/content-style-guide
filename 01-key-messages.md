## How we talk about ourselves

Our company's legal entity name is "Vendasta Technologies, Inc." Our trade name is "Vendasta." Use "Vendasta Technologies, Inc." only when writing legal documents or contracts. Otherwise, use "Vendasta."

Refer to Vendasta as “we”, not “it.” 

* Vendasta has partners.
* Vendasta’s partners have clients.
* Local businesses have customers.

Vendasta has many different types of partners, which can make it difficult to sum up in a few words. The catch-all term is resellers. Depending on the content you’re writing, you may need to be more specific than that. Generally, agencies or digital agencies, traditional media companies, and B2B companies are fine. 

Capitalize the proper names of Vendasta products, features, pages, and tools. When referencing products in third-party places, such as a guest blog on another website, include "Vendasta" in the name on first mention.

* Business Center (in support materials)
* Vendasta Business Center (in press release or guest blog)

There are a few tricky scenarios and special grammar cases with certain terms. Please use the following:

* Snapshot Report, not Snapshot
* VendastaCon, not Vendastacon or VCon
* Sales & Success Center, not Sales and Success Center
* Master Key, not Masterkey or MasterKey

Avoid using abbreviations in outward-facing materials (e.g., VBC, RM, SM, etc.).

Other internal terms, such as PID and AGID, should not be used externally, either in writing or when speaking to partners.

Vendasta’s internal CRM is Sales & Success Center, not Vendasta Money Factory or VMF. We are currently trying to eliminate money factory terms. Also, when referring to our sales and success teams, the entire division is called Distribution.
