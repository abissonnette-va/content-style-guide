Consistency and clarity are key when talking about Vendasta in any format. Please review the following key messages on a regular basis and make sure that all outward-facing material you're in charge of is kept up to date.

## Company Facts

Having consistent numbers about the size of our company is crucial for both legal reasons and building trust with our audiences.

The most current company stats can be found in the [Vendasta KPIs](https://www.vendasta.com/kpi#), although the following numbers are the ones that are currently approved for external communications:

* 1,100+ resellers / partners
* 13,000+ salespeople on the Vendasta platform
* 670,000+ local businesses in Vendasta's system
* 250+ employees
* Data on 24 million local businesses

The preferred way of phrasing our reseller and local business stats is: "There are over 1,100 resellers selling to 670,000 local businesses with Vendasta's platform."

## Asset Kits

Vendasta Asset Kits are top-level resources for anyone in the company to find info, messaging, presentations, and resources for any of the products we make. They can be found on the intranet [here](https://sites.google.com/vendasta.com/intranet2/platform-products/asset-kits?authuser=0).

## How we talk about ourselves

Our company's legal entity name is "Vendasta Technologies, Inc." Our trade name is "Vendasta." Use "Vendasta Technologies, Inc." only when writing legal documents or contracts. Otherwise, use "Vendasta."

Refer to Vendasta as “we”, not “it.” 

* Vendasta has partners.
* Vendasta’s partners have clients.
* Local businesses have customers.

Vendasta has many different types of partners, which can make it difficult to sum up in a few words. The catch-all term is resellers. Depending on the content you’re writing, you may need to be more specific than that. Generally, agencies or digital agencies, traditional media companies, and B2B companies are fine. 

Our partners' clients are local businesses, not small businesses or SMBs. We used to use the term SMBs a lot, but it doesn't quite cover all of the business owners using our products and services. Futhermore, the initialism can be confusing to people who don't know what it stands for. In general, try to use the term local businesses whenever possible.

Capitalize the proper names of Vendasta products, features, pages, and tools. When referencing products in third-party places, such as a guest blog on another website, include "Vendasta" in the name on first mention.

* Business Center (in support materials)
* Vendasta Business Center (in press release or guest blog)

There are a few tricky scenarios and special grammar cases with certain terms. Please use the following:

* Snapshot Report, not Snapshot
* VendastaCon, not Vendastacon or VCon
* Sales & Success Center, not Sales and Success Center
* Master Key, not Masterkey or MasterKey

Avoid using abbreviations in outward-facing materials (e.g., VBC, RM, SM, etc.).

Other internal terms, such as PID and AGID, should not be used externally, either in writing or when speaking to partners.

Vendasta’s internal CRM is Sales & Success Center, not Vendasta Money Factory or VMF. We are currently trying to eliminate money factory terms. Also, when referring to our sales and success teams, the entire division is called Distribution.
